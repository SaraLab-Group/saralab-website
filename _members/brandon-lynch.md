Brandon was the first Bachelor student to graduate from the SaraLab and received the chancellor's award for his thesis work. As an undergraduate bioengineering student he worked in the SaraLab as a research assistant while pursuing his project on  characterization, comparing the performance of different types of lenses (achromatic doublets and high-end photography lenses)  in home-built optical systems in the lab. He now has an awesome job with the SaraLab's friends at Femtotest, where he employs his new skills as an optical engineer in sensor and waveguide testing. When not in the lab, Brandon enjoys playing guitar and fishing and is also reported to be a pretty decent surfer.
