Gustav is like Sara a graduate of KTH (the Royal Institute of Technology) in Stockholm, Sweden (BSc Engineering Physics, MSc Aerospace Engineering). He spent a summer at UC Santa Cruz and in the UC Santa Barbara Nanotech facility, helping Sara get the lab started and learning how to make diffractive optics devices. Stolen to the SaraLab from NASA (with whom we still maintain a great relationship and collaboration) during a ski trip to Lake Tahoe; Gustav has since his time in California spent one year at the European Space Agency and now just started his Ph.D. at MIT, working on rocket propulsion and satelites. Sara and Gustav met at the Science For Life Laboratory in Stockholm, where they both worked with Professor Brismar and the mentorship from Sara laid the groundworks for a cherished friendship. An eternal supporter of the SaraLab, Gustav is always happy to come back to California to help. If you can't find him, try looking behind a Sony mirrorless camera.
