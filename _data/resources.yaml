- title: Aberration Corrected Multifocus Microscopy with Camera Array (M25)
  group: research
  image: images/research/m25.jpg
  description: "This project explores the recording of 3D volumes fast and simultaneously by capturing 25 focal planes based on a novel design of an aberration-corrected multifocus microscopy (MFM). Potential applications include: neuron dynamics, embryo development, chromatin structure imaging in organisms with thin or transparent tissue (C.elegans, Drosophila larvae, hydra) or near the surface (mouse cortex, lamprey spinal cord, zebrafish)"

  description: "This imaging modality alleviates the problem of insufficient volumetric acquisition speed in super-resolution biological imaging. Combining structured illumination microscopy (SIM) wide-field super-resolution technique with multifocus (MFM) volumetric acquisition speed one can image biological specimens beyond the classical diffraction limit minimizing photoxicity."

- title: Image Analysis and Denoising
  group: research
  image: images/research/denoise.png
  description: "One open challenge in microscopy and imaging systems is image reconstruction and denoising of low-light and contrast datasets. The goal of denoising a dataset is to estimate the original data from an acquired noisy dataset by detecting and supressing the noise in the data."
