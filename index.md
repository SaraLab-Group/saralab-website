# Optical Microscopy and Bioelectronics Development Laboratory

New discovery in Biology and Medicine is strongly driven by new possibilities to visualize the processes of life. To see new things, the SaraLab lab invents and **custom builds new types of optical elements and imaging systems**. Specific problems in Biology demand that we push technology to the limit in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution. We focus our work on harnessing the power of diffractive **Fourier optics in microscopy**. This involves design and hands-on nanofabrication of diffractive optics elements for simultaneous 3D imaging using [**Multifocus microscopy**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161287/) and [**super-resolution microscopy**](https://www.osapublishing.org/DirectPDFAccess/C653C23B-C7CA-4F5F-B35C1D7A25981F71_370746/boe-8-9-4135.pdf?da=1&id=370746&seq=0&mobile=no).
